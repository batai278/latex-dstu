\chapter*{Abstract}

Analysis of testing results is a valuable tool in assessing students
with their academic standing, however current testing systems focus
only in the accuracy of answers.

This study aims to design a mathematical model of individual
psychological characteristics on the basis of test results.
This will help to implement testing system which is able
to give relevant advices to person who has passed the test.

To perform the study
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
    principal components analysis was used
    to get most significant data from analyzed samples;
  \item
    Pearson's chi-squared test ($\chi^2$) was used to check
    hypothesis about samples' distribution.
\end{itemize}
